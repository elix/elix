  /**
   * Symbol for the `raiseChangeEvents` property.
   *
   * This property is used by mixins to determine whether they should raise
   * property change events. The standard HTML pattern is to only raise such
   * events in response to direct user interactions. For a detailed discussion
   * of this point, see the Gold Standard checklist item for
   * [Propery Change Events](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki/Property%20Change%20Events).
   *
   * The above article describes a pattern for using a flag to track whether
   * work is being performed in response to internal component activity, and
   * whether the component should therefore raise property change events.
   * This `raiseChangeEvents` symbol is a shared flag used for that purpose by
   * all Elix mixins and components. Sharing this flag ensures that internal
   * activity (e.g., a UI event listener) in one mixin can signal other mixins
   * handling affected properties to raise change events.
   *
   * All UI event listeners (and other forms of internal handlers, such as
   * timeouts and async network handlers) should set `raiseChangeEvents` to
   * `true` at the start of the event handler, then `false` at the end:
   *
   *     this.addEventListener('click', event => {
   *       this[symbols.raiseChangeEvents] = true;
   *       // Do work here, possibly setting properties, like:
   *       this.foo = 'Hello';
   *       this[symbols.raiseChangeEvents] = false;
   *     });
   *
   * Elsewhere, property setters that raise change events should only do so it
   * this property is `true`:
   *
   *     set foo(value) {
   *       // Save foo value here, do any other work.
   *       if (this[symbols.raiseChangeEvents]) {
   *         const event = new CustomEvent('foo-changed');
   *         this.dispatchEvent(event);
   *       }
   *     }
   *
   * In this way, programmatic attempts to set the `foo` property will not
   * trigger the `foo-changed` event, but UI interactions that update that
   * property will cause those events to be raised.
   *
   * @var {boolean} raiseChangeEvents
