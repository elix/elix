/**
 * This mixin creates references to elements in a component's Shadow DOM subtree.
 *
 * This adds a member on the component called `this.$` that can be used to
 * reference shadow elements with IDs. E.g., if component's shadow contains an
 * element `<button id="foo">`, then this mixin will create a member
 * `this.$.foo` that points to that button.
 *
 * Such references simplify a component's access to its own elements. In
 * exchange, this mixin trades off a one-time cost of querying all elements in
 * the shadow tree instead of paying an ongoing cost to query for an element
 * each time the component wants to inspect or manipulate it.
 *
 * This mixin expects the component to define a Shadow DOM subtree and, when
 * that has been done, to invoke [symbols.shadowCreated](symbols#shadowCreated).
 * You can create the shadow subtree yourself, or make use of
 * [ShadowTemplateMixin](ShadowTemplateMixin).
 *
 * This mixin is inspired by Polymer's [automatic
 * node finding](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/local-dom.html#node-finding)
 * feature.
 *
 * An example of code that uses `ShadowReferencesMixin` is
 * [TabStripWrapper](TabStripWrapper).
 *
 * @module ShadowReferencesMixin
 * @param base {Class} - The base class to extend
 * @returns {Class} The extended class

        // tries to access this.$. That might introduce some complexity – if the
