/**
 * Adds a `focus-ring` class to the element when (and only when) it receives
 * focus via the keyboard. This is useful for buttons and other components that
 * don't generally show a focus ring for mouse/touch interaction.
 *
 * The following demo shows button that display a focus ring only when
 * you move the focus onto them via the keyboard, and not with the mouse or touch.
 *
 * [Button components using FocusRingMixin](/demos/focusRing.html)
 *
 * This is inspired by work on the `:focus-ring` pseudo-selector.
 * See https://github.com/wicg/focus-ring for details.
 *
 * This mixin manages a `focus-ring` class on an element that be used to
 * suppress the default focus ring unless the keyboard was used. The element's
 * stylesheet should include a CSS rule of the form:
 *
 *     :host(:focus:not(.focus-ring)) {
 *       outline: none;
 *     }
 *
 * An example of an element using `FocusRingMixin` is
 * [LabeledTabButton](LabeledTabButton).
 *
 * @module FocusRingMixin
 * @param base {Class} - The base class to extend
 * @returns {Class} The extended class
