    The Elix project seeks to provide a comprehensive set of
    solid, well-designed web components that implement very common user
    interface patterns. Each component can be used as is, or as the foundation
    for new components.
  </p>
  <p>
    See the main
    <a href="https://github.com/elix/elix">Elix</a>
    repository for details.

  <h3>Tests</h3>
  <p>
    Run all the tests, in your browser: <a href="test/">right here (and now)</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Demos</h3>

    components. See <a href="demos/">all demos</a> here.

    Components with a prominent horizontal axis or focus on direction are designed to
    flip their logic in right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew. Those components
    have demo variations that exercise their right-to-left support, including
    <a href="demos/slidingCarouselRightToLeft.html">Carousel</a>,
    <a href="demos/drawerRightToLeft.html">Drawer</a>,
    <a href="demos/tabsRightToLeft.html">Tabs</a>, and
    <a href="demos/toastRightToLeft.html">Toast</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The project also includes an extensive series of
    <a href="https://github.com/elix/elix/tree/master/mixins">web component mixins</a> and
    auxiliary components you can use to create your own custom elements. The
    mixins are used in the component demos above, but you can also see some
